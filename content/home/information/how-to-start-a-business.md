As a student, you are young and inexperienced, unlike the third age (50-65) whose start-up enterprises tend to reflect their experiences in particular industries, your idea will most likely be fresh and new that can seem non-starter to most people.

Remember principal-agent problem! as a business owner, you are the principal that has invested the cash, own or otherwise in a business not a hobby, you watch your investment with anxious vigilance, it is not the own boss fairy tale you imagined but a continuous time-consuming, physically and mentally draining process, there is also a question on whether you have got what it takes to be an entrepreneur, boffins at many universities have conducted countless research to determine whether entrepreneurs are born or made, do not ever bother try to find out whether you have what it takes to become an entrepreneur as the fact is; It is the forces of either opportunity or necessity that corners people into becoming entrepreneurs, when either force strikes it will bring out the courage you never knew you had.

>Having read all the above, do not let these facts and statistics make you feel less confident, enthusiastic or positive about your business idea. Just remember, 'having a good business idea is one thing, transforming it into a good business is another', unlike start-ups of the times when W.K. Kellogg and his brother Dr John accidentally flaked wheat berry sourced locally and created the delicious recipe for Kellogg's Corn Flakes sold mainly by mail order to their ex-patients or William Procter and James Gamble that met by chance through marriage started a bold new enterprise - P & G where initially Procter began as a one person operation - manufacturing, selling and delivering candles made from locally sourced raw materials to his customers in the local area and Gamble was running his own local soap and candle shop with a friend made from locally sourced raw materials or Dr John S Pemberton that invented Coca-Cola tried it out on customers at his local chemist, Jacobs' Pharmacy, where it proved so popular it immediately went on sale at five cents a glass and so forth where a new business used to move through distinct stages of growth namely local, national and international; today, thanks to communications and information revolution, a 21st century start-up can easily leapfrog these stages and go global more or less right away - facing a whole new set of complex problems and challenges that comes with running a business across different cultures and ways of doing it respectively, meaning, you need more knowledge, that said you do not need a Masters of business Administration degree, solid grasp of business basics and information will do just fine.
