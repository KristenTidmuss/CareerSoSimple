Jobs market can be difficult to crack whether you are trying to get employed for the first time or have experience but basic rules stay the same, that is, behind every job there is a skill set, that is, a collection of soft skills, experience and qualifications requirement.
When job-hunting, you are simply trying to match your skill set with particular jobs.

The threshold of every career is a relevant breakthrough entry job. Unless you are one of those few exceptional students that has been offered a job before graduation (head-hunted); competition for entry level professional or highly skilled vacancies is fierce as there are too few for too many candidates and therefore to get to a job, you have to make the cut that is avoid elimination, as in a golf tournament through different phases as specified by a human resources or appointed in-house or third party delegate(s) or agencies, where, you have to convince them that you have better skillset than the competition, on paper or web, through CVs, application forms, covering letters and in person through job interviews; preliminary success comes from effective written communication and final a combination of verbal and body language where all depends on your attitude, ability to pay attention, evaluate and retain information.

See how the whole recruitment and selection process works below.

# Recruitment
The function of recruitment is to attract potential candidates for employment in a timely and cost-effective way.
This is done through vacancy/job advertisements on media; A job advert comprises job description - all the necessary information about role and responsibilties of a vacancy that can assist a candidate's decision to pursue it or not. The type of media used depends on the role. Today, due to decline in newspaper readership and widespread use of World Wide Web and Internet, both desktop and mobile devices are media of choice. Recruiters use both their own websites and specialist third party job boards to place ads.

#### Job Description
Every enterprise organise its activities by department/functions, appoint a relevant head/function manager, allocate them budget and objectives within a specified timescale, delegate responsibilities to assemble a team on their shoulders.
When an employee leaves or the workload increases, heads/managers have to justify to human resources as to why they need replacement/new hire to fill the vacancy and describe what they're looking for, in most cases - department/function managers prefer an employee that can hit the ground running on day one and help their respective departments to achieve its objectives within budget, if satisfied, human resources will then write job description accordingly, so next time you see an entry job that requires years of experience, don't jump and blame human resources or hiring managers, they are a doing it on department/functions behalf.
For Your Information, when it comes to interview stage, it's most likely; the process will involve both the relevant head/manager and HR representative.
>**Note:** There is nowhere that says; an entry level is for a fresh-faced, inexperienced school leaver or graduate, this notion is all to do with assumptions and generalized interpretation not reality.

#### How to Respond to a Job Advertismnet
There are two solid reasons that will make you, a smart candidate respond to a particular job ad, first, you have identified things of real value an employer is offering and not fallen for the gimmicks, and second, you are sure, you meet the job requirements.

##### Examples of job advertisement gimmicks!
- **No day is the same:** this for an odd-job man not a professional.
- **Investor in people employer:** the most you will do as part of training and development is reading Standard Operating Procedures (S.O.Ps) and similar sort, anything of more value but pricey will have strings attached to it.
- **Cutting edge technology:** means the technology that was latest when was first installed nobody knows how long ago.
- **State-of-the-art-facilities:** means the state of the buildings and furnishings as they were at some unspecified time ages ago.
- **Competitive salary:** means you will get paid similar to what other employers are paying for similar role where you will never get rich and thus have a reason to come to work and no reason to leave your current employer for a competitor.
- **Competitive pension scheme:** workplace pension is compulsory, it just means they will match your percentage contribution if is close enough to the minimum required by the law and cap it if is otherwise.
- **Market-leading health plans:** most treatments will still be on the NHS.
- **Excellent career progression opportunities:** do not bet your money on this, the bigger the employer the more the office politics and the smaller the employer the less room to manoeuvre, you will have to wait for your boss to die or move elsewhere and pray they cannot find a replacement elsewhere externally.
- **25 days holiday + Bank Holidays:** Statutory annual leave entitlement for a full time employee is 28 days, do your Maths.

Now that you have read the example of gimmicks above, it is easier to pinpoint the real value a job is offering on any ad, as for job requirements, there are only two on every job advertisement namely essential and desirable.
You must exactly match essential requirements as per job description as they form the basis for consideration of suitable candidates, desirable requirements are a complement.
So, if the job advertisement is saying a border collie (working dog) is essential do not put poodle (pet dog) as a substitute.
In terms of a means to responding to a recruiter's advertisement, you can do it through a single or a combination of an application form, curriculum vitae and covering letter as specified by the advertiser.

>#### TIP:
>A cv is not one size fits all solution to every job application, you can have one template and customize it accordingly or send it to get binned.
If you are interested in a role and have unshakable belief you are capable of doing it but you somehow feel you cannot fulfil the whole of essential requirements, do not dismiss yourself instead explain on your cv on how you will offset what is missing.

#### Selection
Selection process deals with all submitted applications, where the aim is to identify candidates that are deemed most likely to fulfil the requirements of the role, draw a shortlist and convince those that are very suitable; it is in their best interest to join the employer.

#### Selection Facts and Figures
The following facts and figures highlight what rank highest to employers when it comes to selection in ascending order, contrary to a typical young person's belief, that is, success in the professional and highly skilled labour markets is hinged on a good degree.

##### Soft Skills
Soft skills are generic skills that apply to every job.
Nothing is as important to employers than an employee that is able, willing to do the job and can get along with other employees; any individual with such qualities will have sufficient soft skills, the exact generic skills you are deemed to have developed during the general education phase.

##### Figures
More than 80% of employers rank interpersonal also known as (a.k.a) life or people or social or soft or transferrable skills the highest when it comes to selection.

>#### TIP:
>On personal level, interpersonal skills are useful due to the fact that there is nothing like a job for life, they are quite handy when you are forced or choose to change a job

#### Work Experience
There is a say 'training is useful, but is no substitute for domain-specific experience'; experience eliminate the need for training from scratch, a new employee walks in, gets minimum or no training and he/she does the job.

##### Figures
Top employers reserve between 40% to 80% of entry level professions to candidates who have previously carried out internships, work experience or industrial placements with them. Leaving the rest to others where priority is given to those with some previous relevant work experience, meaning, if you do not have any experience at all, you are least likey to succeed.

#### Qualifications
Academia rank every qualification on highest grades attained regardless of disciplines, in the world of work, employers rank them lowest as experience has shown them that qualifications as stated on certificates cannot be taken at a face value as a proof of knowledge and skills required for a particular job due to widespread cheating and plagiarism, grade inflation and general poor quality of teaching that has forced most of employers to use ability tests and personality questionnaires to assess them, they can be used at any stage during selection process.
The only secret to passing these tests is practice, the more you do it the more they become like second-nature.

- [proprietary test](http://elearn.pwc.co.uk/psychometric/try.html)

#### Job interviews
Job interview is a face to face or over the phone selling process, when you reach this stage you are closest to a job, there are no secrets only preparation. Use the links below to learn more about interview approaches and tips.

#### Post application feedback
Ideal, if you are unsuccessful with your application you would expect the most decent thing employers should do is give you a feedback, it is not so much they don't care, they just tend to receive a lot of applications per vacancy and they simply have neither time nor resources to go through every application and write personalized feedback.
So if you get none, do not take it personal.

>#### TIP:
>There is no such thing as perfect employers, don't be a disruptive job hopper, you should change jobs or employers only when is essential or an opportunity too good to miss from elsewhere drops on your plate; continuity in one career with one employer can have many benefits to name but a few cumulative holiday entitlements, salary scale, generous severance package when you have to leave unwillfully and so forth but in the end if you still cannot get a job or you just don't want to work for someone else, you have to create one for yourself, to find out more on how to do it, read how to
