The fact of the matter is, without fundamental personal knowledge of facts on work and education, the relationship between a student and a career development practitioner is the same as that of an illiterate congregant and a highly educated priest in the middle ages, the former takes the later advice, information, guidance or sermon as instructions and defeat the whole purpose of independent career decision, you cannot afford to be an illiterate congregant!

The fact of the matter is, without fundamental personal knowledge of facts on work and education, the relationship between a student and a career development practitioner is the same as that of an illiterate congregant and a highly educated priest in the middle ages, the former takes the later advice, information, guidance or sermon as instructions and defeat the whole purpose of independent career decision, you cannot afford to be an illiterate congregant!

All you have to do is, read; Once you have worked through it all to the end, you will have fundamental personal knowledge of facts and in no time you will be able to make one respective career decision (educational, training and occupational choice) that is most accurate, apparent thorough and for the right reasons truly independently regardless of whether you had no career idea, one career idea but not sure about it or too many career ideas initially.

#### Terminology Definitions
- **Clutter:** A large amount of confusing information
- **Impenetrable Jargon:** Language that is impossible to understand
- **Rhetoric:** clevel and persuasive but insincere language
- **Half-Truths:** Statements that mix truth and falsehood with deliberate intent to deceive
- **Expert Blind Spot:** inadvertent omission of information an inexperienced person needs in order to learn about an issue, topic or a task fully
- **Illusion of Impartiality:** Contradiciton, humans are biased by nature
- **Theories and Models:** System of ideas that have very little or nothing to do with reality and practice (purely academic)

>#### NOTE:
>If you have passed the career choice phase, the facts on work and education will come in handy in assessing whether a career you have chosen is a domesticated turkey that will never fly or a soaring eagle, if you are actively looking for work, you have tricks of the trade at your disposal, if you are thinking of further studies, you can with confidence determine whether is worth it or if you want to start a business, you can without a doubt see precisely whether it will succeed.

# Work
A job is the work a person does to earn money where everyone be native or immigrant has a responsibility to seek out not an entitlement (something that everyone has a right to do or have) locally!
A person that has a useful regular job and pay is classed as being in gainful employment where the most dominant form and worth doing by far is the paid than self.

#### Simple fact about the labor market
>Labour market like any market has two sides, people seeking employment as sellers and employers as buyers and theories of supply and demand for labour apply in most instances. A job vacancy is a derived demand, it can be brand new or vacated post. People seeking employment compete to fill job vacancies.

#### Factors that affect employment prospects worldwide
- **Economic rent:** value of wages earned cover the basic costs of living - rent/mortgage, utilities (electricity, gas, water and sewerage) bills, clothing, food and so forth that is necessary to keep an employee in his/her current employment.
- **Geographical Mobility of Labour:** the degree to which unqualified and qualified people are able and willing to move from one geographical area to another to do menial jobs or work in a particular field relevant to their qualifications respectively.
    - **Example:** An unqualified person born and bread in the seaside resort of Blackpool willingly commutes or relocates to Greater Manchester to work in a factory or further afield across the United Kingdom or emigrates overseas or a qualified doctor from the same place follow the footsteps of the former to work in hospital elsewhere other than hometown or both change employers locally, nationaly or internationally not role.
- **Occupational Mobility of Lablor:** Occupational mobility of labour - the degree to which people are able and willing to move from one particular job to an unrelated one.
    - **Example:** An janitor/cleaner becomes a security officer, A doctor becomes an Electrical engineer.

>#### FACT:
>- Professions and highly skilled occupations tend to have higher wages, low occupational mobility due to the curse of higher qualifications and occupational experience requirements but high geographical;
elementary occupations tend to have low wages, both high geographical and occupational mobility, the blessing of low qualifications and experience requirements.
>- Irreversible globalization and constant technological advances are agents that accelerate significant changes in labour mobility and no one is protected or exempted from their effects, where globalization allows for little or no restriction of movement of labour across international borders, technology wipes out some jobs (skillset obsolescence), changes and creates others; together they eliminate job security (job for life) in most sectors and confine local to geography, local jobs for local people and study-work-retire model to history on one hand and the absolute need for everyone to learn about the wider world beyond the school gates and confinement of an individual country's borders on the other.

#### Employers and Jobs
The internal reality is: all employers are more or less the same as first, they operate according to similar norms that do not hold particular skills an employee has gained whilst in education in the same regard as teachers do neither do they promise the greatest success for the brightest and most deserving and second, they are bureaucratic as they share in common system of rules, hierarchy of authority (top, middle, low tiers of management) and specialization in their structures, as for jobs, all of them regardless of a title whether be conventional or otherwise are overrated as most of what every employee loosely 'a professional' does daily is repetitive and boring, a consequence of division of labour, and thus never take the idiom 'a cog in the machine' with heavy negative connotation as the fact is 'every employee that is doing his/her regular job within an enterprise is an important cog that is playing its part to keep the wheels turning', meaning, when it comes to considering who to work for or what job to do in the future respectively, never follow your own imagination or fall for the HYPE you hear/heard about an employer or a job from the outside.

**WARNING!**
The bigger and the more individualistic culture an enterprise has; the fiercely competitive, overqualified and territorial employees are and consequently the less the cohesion which ultimately create an environment where only the mentally strong can survive and thrive.

>#### TIP:
>Specialization creates an imbalance between those with superior domain-specific (subject/field) experience, knowledge or hard skills in one word experts and those without or novices respectively and thus justifies the exclusion of the later.

#### Example: Medical Field
- **Orthopaedic surgeon** is for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disorders of the bones, joints, ligaments, tendons and muscles.
- **Plastic surgeon** is for repair and reconstruction of missing or damaged tissue and skin.
- **Neurosurgeon** is for disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system.

Domain-specific experience, knowledge or skill is not transferable across domains, and thus, orthopaedic surgeon is justifiably excluded from plastic and neurosurgery jobs respectively and the other way round.
There are two facts we can draw from specialization, one, if you want to make a career out of something, you must have to become a master of it as being a jack of all trades and a master of none will not get you far, and two, at some point whilst in education or seeking employment when you come across a tenure/chair professor of this or that, a consultant physician/doctor of this or that and so forth with unhinged sense of self-entitlement, do not be intimaded by his/her deep expertise, his/her knowledge is only domain specific and his/her elevated performance in relevant narrow field is due to exploitation of familiar tasks that he/she has intensely practiced regularly for a long time, meaning, sky's the limit, you can achieve expertise in any field if you put your mind to it.

# Education

What you get from every completed phase of education is qualifications.
Qualifications when they refer to knowledge and skills to be precise the sufficient pertinent background knowledge of general or specific nature where anyone who is deficient in it, will fail to grasp the full meaning of variety of things and also struggle to unlock new ideas and experiences that lie ahead and hard skills - the teachable and measurable abilities respectively not certificates with grades to show one has completed required schooling or training from an officially recognized or authorized institution at an expensive university degree level or equivalent cheaper but limited higher vocational or apprenticeship serve as absolutely necessary minimum entry requirement to most traditional careers, meaning, career aspirations must match your educational goals, do not leave school at 16 with no more than compulsory General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) qualifications follow your native folks to do locally available traditional occupations of elementary nature as that is most likely what you will end up doing throughout your adult working life or worse stuck in the vicious circle of poverty and welfare dependence, on and off the dole!

#### Compulsory Education
The purpose of compulsory education is to give students basic general knowledge and skills at the level and amount that they can take in and understand fully and use it as their own whilst in education and thereafter in their adult work and social lives.
However, there is not a single agreed criterion on what compulsory education should involve but one rule of thumb is compulsory education is best when curriculum and syllabuses are chosen and developed based on a universal understanding of what subjects knowledge and aforementioned skills are absolutely necessary for the future engaged workers and citizens not on teaching to the test - a compass pointing in the wrong direction and tool that never weed out the inept - those generally lacking the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out basic tasks and behave responsibly as citizens as many students memorize materials to pass the exams rather than learn.

The following subject knowledge and hard skills (teachable and measurable abilities) are absolutely necessary:
- **Basic numeracy:** Understanding arithmetic (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication) geometry (shapes), logic - the connection and combination through eliminating fallacies, statistics - how to reason using trend patterns and probabilities.
- **Laboratory science:** Understanding methods that employs empirical experimentation to draw conclusions - in Biology (living matter), Chemistry (composition and behaviour of matter) and Physics (matter in relation to energy).
- **Use of Information and Communications Technology:** Word processors, email, databases, spreadsheets, reprographics, the internet and world wide web and so forth .
- **Written And Verbal Communication:** Understanding the primary building blocks of reading and writing, composition and grammar, the ability to argue properly and avoid argumentum ad hominem - a situation that occurs when an arguer attacks the person that they are engaged in an argument with, rather than the validity of the person's arguments.
- **Politics and economics:** Understanding of the world of ideas - freedom is responsibility, enterprise and capitalism
- **Geography:** The environment, sustainable development, proximity and trade.
- **History:** Understanding of events that have affected the course of history and the modern world - slavery, colonialism, Bretton Woods, Treaty of Rome.

>#### TIP:
>The subjects above should form the criteria for your GCSE selection, as choosing them will give you more options on further and higher education later on.

#### Generic Soft Skills
Soft skills interpersonal, life or people or social or transferrable) have to do with nature and nurture, some people are naturally gifted others have to learn, use and re-use them repetitively until they become second nature through curricula and extra-curricula activities, to name but a few - culture and language, community, media, military, social activism, individual and team sports, group discussions, drama, debate sessions and so forth.

The following below is a list of common soft skills:
- **Communication:** putting grammar and vocabulary into practice.
- **Work ethic:** can do attitude, work does not have to be a chore.
- **Flexibility:** priorities change, you must be willing to accommodate changes.
- **Adaptability:** world of work is constantly changing, you have to change with it or wither and die.
- **International cultural awareness:** we live and work in a multicultural society, you must appreciate cultural differences.
- **leadership:** do not confuse leadership with management, the former is getting the job done by taking the lead and the later is to get the job done by others.
- **teamwork:** Working together in harmony to achieve a common goal efficiently and effectively.
- **personal motivation:** intrinsically, there is that little annoying or pleasant person inside everyone of us that is nudging and nagging us to get or do something.
- **organization:** without organization, you have chaos, the more organized the better the allocation of resources.
- **Time management:** prioritization of tasks, you cannot do everything, you have to rank tasks, critical have to be done before major and minor in that order.
- **commercial awareness (business acumen, business/client focus):** Being conscious of what is happening in a wider business world and how it affects a specific enterprise's internal activities, in the short, medium and long term, obviously, not as straightforward as the other soft skills on the list above but still not rocket science. With a few examples, you can grasp the basics in no time and at some point later, on autopilot, recall the materials and transfer them automatically in real-time to solve routine and emerging business issues.Have a look at a handful of competing multinational corporations (MNC):** corporations with facilities and other assets in at least one country other than their countries of origin and conglomerates:** corporations that are made up of a number of different, unrelated businesses, the facilitating agents without which globalization would not have materialised and links to their directly or indirectly competing products/services listed below:

#### Further Education Qualifications
Further education is sandwiched between general and higher (degree level) education, apart from 'A' levels or equivalent Scottish Highers, Welsh and Scottish Baccalaureates, International Baccalaureates whose purpose is to prepare students for entry into higher levels of specialized study at higher education institutions, the remainder of further education is like a middle child suffering from identity crisis as it has no clearly recognised and shared core purpose and thus not worth pursuing at all.

#### Undergraduate Degree Qualifications
An undergraduate degree purpose is to give students advanced domain-specific knowledge and skills, in other words an undergraduate degree purpose is to give students depth or expertise.
A degree in a particular field (major/specialization) often form the basis of an individual's career.
When it comes to choosing a university to attend, rank matters! as there are leading universities and others, the advantage of the leading is the affluent, well-connected home and international students they attract, a priceless alumni, a social capital in an institutionalized form as the network can only be created by attending a specific institution, very useful if you are intending to pursue a career in politics dominated by dynasties, judiciary and the press dominated by the independently educated (newscasters (anchormen/women), editors, judges, you name it, industries dominated by family business or family-connected and referral business plus those jobs with general degree or no degree requirements, where 'who you know is more important than what you know', as for teaching, university is where you do self directed learning (a skill you are assumed to have developed through supplementary home or library self study whilst in earlier phases of education) and academics that call the shots validate your work; As for courses; there are tens of thousands offered without warranty taught through e-learning, projects, lectures, lab and practical, supervisions, field-trips, seminars, classes and so forth.

Use the links below to find out which are leading universities and power of alumni.

#### Buyer Beware!
Deception and Manipulation, that is, exploitation of gullible people's psychological weaknesses are not business models [the products or service offering, the customer base (target market) and revenues generation] confined to fashion, diet, fitness, law, politics, religion, press, you name it;
Universities use the same model by offering students thousands of fast food quality courses with attractive and complex Michelin star restaurant titles plus hefty price tags in fees without telling them they are extensions of a few subjects, presenting their slam dunk (degree courses that are certain to pay dividends) and Mickey mouse (worthless/irrelevant degree courses) uniformly, giving them a percentage of their graduates in employment six months after graduation without explaining what percentage of that is on degree specific or non graduate jobs, as if they honestly disclose everything, there will be mass lay offs and even bankruptcies.

Use the links below to find out about which courses and subjects have best prospects and degree alternatives so that you are not played for a fool by appearances of courses and occupations on glossy prospectuses - (marketing tools) devised by institutions to their advantage and choose a degree course that is advantageous, necessary and worthwhile.

- [Worthless Degrees](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-liberal-arts-degrees-worthless-steven-waechter)

>#### TIP:
>When choosing a university to attend the only thing we tend to consider is the easy bit, that is, the logistics of getting to a campus, however, we tend to overlook the most important logistics connected to internships, work experience or industrial placements that are essential to the development of relevant hard skills as university courses are predominantly theory based, or even if lab work is involved, it is a known fact lab never match the real world demands, think of a car that has passed standardized lab testing with flying colours but guarantees no matching real world on road performance and eventually job itself.

>#### Some Few UK Fats:
>- East Anglia, the South-East, the East Midlands and Yorkshire are agricultural heartlands.
>- The West Midlands is the industrial heartland.
>- The South East is distinctive for its service industries such as insurance, banking and shipping.

Meaning, you have to explore which sector of industry your chosen major/specialization is in, namely primary, secondary or tertiary because they will determine where most opportunities are geographically as well as the nature of work, that is, desk (a job that involves working mostly at a desk in an office) and non-desk (field, shop, factory, laboratory e.t.c.).

#### Higher Degrees Above Bachelor
The more educated, the more ignorant as the narrow specialism weakens your ability to make a connection among discipline silos!
Unless you are planning to become an academic or a researcher both primarily a preserve of universities; it is not worth pursuing as it does neither improve your prospects nor guarantee premium wages.
That said; it is best to use a bachelor's degree to get employed first as employers do set aside a budget for training and development where depending on your role and level you can choose or be advised to pursue a higher degree as part of your Continuous Personal Development (CPD) and they will foot part or the whole of the bill and very likely top-up your wages post-completion.

#### Self-Taught
For anything you are not taught in the classroom, offset by doing it yourself as a semi-autodidact through other sources as in the world of work nobody is interested in your sorry stories about how poor your education was, they probably went through the same.
Besides, self- taught knowledge is what differentiates an individual from others, as the prescriptive formal education is largely homogeneous, that is, we all study the same or similar courses, attend the same or similar universities, read the same or similar books, attend the same or similar lectures and sometimes even taught by the same teachers that have never bothered to change their outdated teaching materials since they started teaching.
>#### True Story:
>Some years ago when the creator of CAREERSOSIMPLE was in primary and secondary phases of education, there were two formats of learning namely class reader and class library he was introduced to, as the names suggest class reader has to do with teacher guided learning based on curriculum and syllabuses in a classroom that is a known fact it has intensity of focus problem - every student has to concentrate on subjects to make up the required grades and class library that has to do with own choice where he was encouraged to choose and read about as many subjects and topics outside the classroom through books, magazines, newspapers, journals and other sources as part of self-development and make it a habit, he encourages you to do the same as it turned him into a confident person that is capable of holding a conversation on topics unrelated to his profession and ultimately at ease in both social and professional situations to-date.
